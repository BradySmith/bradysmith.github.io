Are round avatars still cool? I'm Brady Smith and although I've been programming since elementary school, I've only recently started to pursue the field deeply in the last few years. I'm hoping this blog can be a record of my success and failures as a new dev.

Currently I'm working as an developer in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan while finishing up my final year of Computer Science studies.

I like tough problems with simple solutions. I haven't been at this long enough to pick a favourite language. I love vim and the terminal. I prefer spaces to tabs and single quotes to double quotes.

Feel free to get in touch via email (brady_smith [at] outlook.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UnfamousBrady) if you want to chat or checkout my [Github](https://github.com/BradySmith) for some of things I think are neat.
