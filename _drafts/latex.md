What is [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/)? It's a spiffed up version of TeX, targeted at content-creators. What is TeX? TeX is a type-setting system which is used to generate technical documents and excels when it comes to formating mathematical expressions. 

LaTeX is something I've actually been interested in since my first year of university when I was trying to find out a good way of keeping track of Caluclus notes digitally. It generates these beautifully formated expressions that if you've ever read a [math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation) article on Wikipedia or seen on in a textbook you'd recognize as being similar. The problem is, however, that it can be extremely finicky to write which makes them difficult to take notes in where speed is important.
