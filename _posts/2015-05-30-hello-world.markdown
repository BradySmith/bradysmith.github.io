First post! (ha. ha.)

This blog is the implementation of something that I've wanted to do ever since I went back to school for Computer Science. The idea behind it is that I'm hoping it's going to become a record of my progress as I work to become a better developer - some sort of public record for myself that reminds that I am improving.

I'm hoping that it'll remind me that I'm always going to be learning and that over the next few years I'll be able to look back and realize how wrong I was, how right I was and just how horrible my javascript really was.

I'm not setting rules about what I'm going to post about or how often I'm going to update, but instead, I'm going to write about things that I'm proud of, ideas that are important to me and problems that I've solved.

Let's see what's going to happen.

{% highlight bash %}
    echo "Hello World!"
{% endhighlight %}
